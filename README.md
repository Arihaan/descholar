## Key Features

- **Decentralized Scholarship Creation**: Organizations can create scholarships by providing essential details like the scholarship name, description, total grant amount, number of grants, and application deadline.
- **Student Application Process**: Students worldwide can apply for scholarships by submitting their personal details and application form through a simple and intuitive interface.
- **Blockchain Transparency**: Funds for the scholarships are securely managed on EDU Chain via smart contracts, ensuring that all transactions are verifiable and immutable.
- **Automatic Grant Distribution**: Once the scholarship creator approves a student's application, the smart contract automatically distributes the grant amount in EDU tokens.
- **Scholarship Management**: Creators can cancel scholarships with a reason and get remaining funds back, or withdraw remaining funds after expiry.
- **Multiple Application Prevention**: Smart contract ensures each student can only apply once to each scholarship.
- **Status Tracking**: Clear status indicators for applications and scholarships, including cancellation reasons and timestamps.

## How It Works

1. **Create a Scholarship**:

   - An organization or donor creates a new scholarship by entering key details, such as the scholarship name, description, grant amount per student, number of available grants, and end date.
   - The organization must deposit the total grant amount (grant amount Ã— number of grants) into the smart contract.

2. **View Available Scholarships**:

   - Users can browse all active scholarships, with clear indicators of remaining grants and end dates.

3. **Apply for a Scholarship**:

   - Students can apply for scholarships by providing their details. The smart contract ensures each student can only apply once per scholarship.

4. **Application Review**:

   - Scholarship creators can review applications and approve deserving students.
   - Applications for cancelled scholarships cannot be approved.

5. **Grant Distribution**:

   - Upon approval, the smart contract automatically transfers the grant amount to the student's wallet.
   - The number of remaining grants decreases accordingly.

6. **Scholarship Management**:
   - Creators can cancel scholarships by providing a reason, receiving back remaining funds
   - After expiry, creators can withdraw any remaining grant funds
   - All actions are transparent and recorded on the blockchain
